# Directory of Churches and Religious Organizations in New Orleans, 1941

## About
This dataset was compiled for a digital humanities project taken at Pratt Institute's School of Information during Spring 2019. The dataset was made using a digital copy of the WPA directory of religious organizations in New Orleans (1941) and includes the following fields: congregation, national affiliation, sub affiliation, church name, building type, congregation race, and address. Each location with a street address was geocoded and locations with only cross streets provided were estimated using internet searches, archival material, and/or Google Maps. Subsets for Catholic, Baptist, Jewish, and Spriritual Churches were created from the full dataset, all of which are included in this repository.

## Projects 
WPA dataset was used for this [ArcGIS Story Map](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=b3a2f898c0ac49819c6faf09e9d80603) about the religious landscape of New Orleans during the New Deal. 

This data was also mapped with [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/) data to show that readlining often occurred in black communities, where black churches were located. You can view the map of redlining in relation to church location [here](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=6f1bbb334220417295f97d3019ff83cd) and also read more about the process of making this map in this [NYARC blog post](http://nyarc.org/content/attending-digital-humanities-summer-institute-dhsi).
