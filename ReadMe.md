The preparation of this dataset was completed by Genevieve Milliken for a digital humanities project at Pratt Institute's School of Information during Spring 2019. Using a digital copy of the WPA directory from HathiTrust, congregation, national affiliation, sub affiliation, church name, building type, congregation race, and address were transferred. Each location with a street address was geocoded and locations with only cross streets provided were estimated using internet searches, archival material, and/or Google Maps. Subsets for Catholic, Baptist, Jewish, and Spriritual Churches were created from the full dataset, all of which are included in this repository.
